 M2M solution transfer begin...

 ...using octree to find regions (works only for tets. in source mesh)

 Enter data structure level to be used
 (1 is max. resolution leading to less search time)
 (typically between 1-5)
 
 Enter info. for entities to be considered [num. ents.=1] : 
 (example, for an entity three values are needed - 92 2 0)
 (where, 92 is entity-tag for specific entity, 2 is entity-dimension for model-face with tag 92 and 0 is closure-flag set to OFF)
 

 M2M solution transfer done...

 Writing solution to file : 
   dest.  solution   : ./restart_dest.10000.1
