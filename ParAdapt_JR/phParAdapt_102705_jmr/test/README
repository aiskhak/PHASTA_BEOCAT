Module:phParAdapt


sun(goliath)
compile:
gmake PARALLEL=mpich2 MPICOMM=ch_p4 MODELER=Parasolid


run adapt-mode:
$MYMPIRUN -np 2 -machinefile goliath ~/develop/phasta/phPAPP/bin/sun4_5/phParAdapt-Parasolid-mpich2 

FROM NOW ON AN INPUT FILE IS REQUIRED (contains all previous command line
args)
=========
adapt.inp
=========
make sure you have set the flags accordingly


run phParAdapt with command line '-h' to display all options

Successful run creates directory 20/ (timestep at which adaptation is done)
that contains:
2-proc_case/              (the phasta input files defined for the new mesh)
refined_p.sms/            (the refined mesh itself in parallel format)
refined_p.<procnum>.sms   (in DEBUG mode only: the partitions in sms-2 format)



test success of solution transfer:
~osahni/develop/phasta/phPost/ViewPara-ASCII/bin/sun4_5/viewPara solution 20 30 20 0 1

(type ~osahni/develop/phasta/phPost/ViewPara-ASCII/bin/sun4_5/viewPara
for all command line args; header...dx is created)


DO NOT try to use "reduce" (ncorp is not included while running in adapt mode)
